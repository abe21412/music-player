# Music Player
A music player web application developed with React, Express, and MongoDB.
To run locally, clone this repository and run ``npm install`` from the root project directory followed by ``npm install`` from the client directory.
You'll need to configure your own .env file with a ``MONGO_URI`` value containing your MongoDB connection string, a ``SECRET`` value containing a string for JWT authentication, and an optional ``PORT`` value for the Express backend.
Then run ``npm run dev`` to start the React and Express development servers. You can also view a live version of the project [here](https://musicplayer-app.herokuapp.com/).
